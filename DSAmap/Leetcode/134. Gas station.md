1. Iterate through the given vectors and check if the total value of `gas` is less than `cost`, this means it is not possible to complete one rotation. Return -1.
2. Iterate through the the given vectors and calculate the tank value. If the tank value `total` is less than zero, this means that the trip cannot start at the current index, update the `result` variable to `i+1` and reset `total` to 0. 
3. Return `result`.
