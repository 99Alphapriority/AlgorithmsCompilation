1. Create a `dp` vector of size `nums.size()` and initialize it with value 1, as minimum subsequence at any given index would be 1.
2. Create a nested for loop that checks all the subsequences till `i` starting from `j`.
```cpp
	for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
	{
		for(int j = 0; j < i; j++)
		{
			
		}
	}
```
3. At every iteration of for loop check if `nums[j]` is less than `nums[i]`, this means that its an increasing subsequence. 
```cpp
	if(nums[j] < nums[i])
		dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
```
4. Store the current max value in `result`.
```cpp
	result = max(result, dp[i]);
```
5. Return `result`.
