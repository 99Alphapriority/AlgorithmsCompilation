1. create a new vector of pair to store the queries in a sorted order.
2. Sort the given intervals vector. 
3. Iterate through the sorted queries vector, check if it is greater than the start interval. 
4. Push the interval size and interval end pair into a priority queue(min heap).
5. Check if the queue is not empty and if the current query is greater than the interval end, pop from the queue.
6. Insert the size at the top of the queue into an `ans` vector.
