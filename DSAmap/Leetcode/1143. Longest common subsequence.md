1. Create a 2D vector such that `dp[i][[j]`, represents the longest subsequence between `text1[0..i]` and `text2[0..j]`.
2. Iterate through the given vector and check if `text1[i-1] == text[j-1]`, this means that `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`.
3. Else, `dp[i][j] = max (dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`. 
4. Return `dp[text1.size()][text2.size()]`.
