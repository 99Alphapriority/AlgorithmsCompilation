1. Iterate through the given vector and find the maximum value. Stote this maximum value in variable high and create another variable low and assign value 1 to it.
   High and low represents the maximum and minimum bananas koko can eat in an hour.
2. Store the high value in another variable ans.
3. Run a WHILE loop until `low <= high
	3.1. Calculate a mid value using the binary search mid formula:
		`mid = low + (high - low)/2;
	3.2. Iterate through the piles vector anc calculate the total hours it will take to eat all the bananas at rate mid bananas per hour.
		`hour += piles[i]/mid;
	3.3. If the hour value calculated is less than the given h value:
		3.3.1. Check if mid is less than ans. If yes, then update ans value to mid.
		3.3.2. This means we can reduce the high value to `mid - 1`.
	3.4. If the calculated hour value is greater than the given hour value this means we need to increase the low value to `mid + 1`.
4. Return the ans.
