1. Iterate through the given string using 2 indices. At the start both the index point to 0.
2. Enter the encountered character in the unordered set and increment the pointer `j`.
3. If the character already exists in the set, remove the character from the set and increment the index `i`.
4. Calculate the length of the current substring and check if its greater than the last substring length.
```cpp
	ans = max(ans, j-i+1);
```
5. Return `ans`.
