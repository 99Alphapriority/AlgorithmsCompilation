1. Create a 2D `dp` vector where each cell stores the number of unique ways yo reach that particular cell.
2. For `dp[0][0]`, there are 0 ways to reach that cell. 
3. For `dp[0][1]` and `dp[1][0]`, there is only 1 way to reach those cells. 
4. Iterate through the `dp` grid and change the value of each cell to the sum of the value of the cell the left and above the current cell.
5. Return `dp[m-1][n-1]`.
