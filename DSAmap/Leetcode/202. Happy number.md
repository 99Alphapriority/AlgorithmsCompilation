1. Use slow and fast pointer approach to check if there is a loop.
2. Create a function that sums the square of the digits of the number. 
3. Create a while loop that checks if the slow and fast pointer are same or if the fast pointer is equal to 1. 
4. Calculate the slow and fast pointer value as follows:
```cpp
	while(slow != fast && fast != 1)
	{
		slow = next(slow);
		fast = next(next(fast));
	}
```
5. After exiting the while loop check if the fast pointer is equal to 1. Then return true.
6. Else return false.
