1. Check if the current node value is less than the `key`, this means that the `key` node is in the right subtree. 
2. Similarly check if the current node value is greater then the `key`, this means that the `key` node is in the left subtree. 
3. If the current node value matches the `key`, then iterate either to the left most node of the right subtree or the rightmost node of the left subtree. Replace the current node value with this node. 
4. Delete the leftmost/rightmost node from the tree.
