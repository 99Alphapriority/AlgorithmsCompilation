1. Create double ended queue variable to keep track of the window maximum value.
```cpp
	deque<int> deck;
```
2. Iterate through all the elements of the `nums` vector. 
3. Insert the index `i` into the queue.
```cpp
	deck.push_back(i);
```
4. Check if the current element is greater than the element at index at the end of the queue. If `true` then remove from the end of the queue.
```cpp
	if(!deck.empty() && num[i] > nums[deck.back()])
	{
		deck.pop_back();
	}
```
5. Check if the element at the front of the queue is within the current sliding window. If not then remove from the element from the front of the queue. 
```cpp
	if(!decl.empty() && deck.front() <= i-k)
	{
		deck.pop_front();
	}
```
6. Once `i` is greater than the window size, insert the element from `nums` pointed by the index element at the front of the queue.
```cpp
	if(i >= k-1)
	{
		ans.push_back(nums[deck.front()]);
	}
```
7. Return `ans`.
