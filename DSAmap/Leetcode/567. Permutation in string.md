1. Create an array of size 26. Increment the value pointed by the indices of all the characters in `s1`.
```cpp
	for(int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++)
		check[s1[i] - 'a']++;
```
2. Iterate through `s2` using two pointers `i` and `j`. Start both the pointers from 0 but only increment `j`.
3. Run a while loop until the character in `s2` pointed by `j` is not present in the `check`.
	1. Add the character in `s2` pointed by `i` to `check`.
```cpp
	while(check[s2[j] - 'a'] == 0)
	{
		check[s2[i] - 'a']++;
		i++;
	}
```
4. Now remove the character in `s2` pointed by `j`. 
5. Check if the size of the window is equal to the length of `s1`.
```cpp
	if(j - i + 1 == s1.length())
		return true;
```
