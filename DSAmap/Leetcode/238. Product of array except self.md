1. Create 2 vectors leftProduct and rightProduct that will store the product of left and right elements of `nums[i]` respectively.
	1.1. leftProduct
		1.1.1. Create a vector of given size.
		1.1.2. Assign 1 to `ans[0]` as there is no left value FOR this index.
		1.1.3. Assign `nums[0]` to `ans[1]`.
		1.1.4. Run a FOR loop starting from index 2 to the end of the given array.
		       The value can be computed as follows:
			`ans[i] = ans[i-1] * nums[i-1];
	1.2. rightProduct
		1.2.1. Create a vector of given size.
		1.2.2. Assign 1 to `ans[size-1]` as there is no right element FOR this index.
		1.2.3. Assign `num[size-1]` to `ans[size-2]`.
		1.2.4. Run a FOR loop from the 3rd last element till the beginning of the given array.
		       The value can be computed as follows:
			`ans[i] = ans[i+1] * nums[i+1];
2. Run a FOR loopfrom 0 to end of the given array.
   The value can be computed as follows:
	`ans[i] = leftProduct[i] * rightProduct[i];
