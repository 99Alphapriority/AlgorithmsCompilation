1. Create a 2D array to keep track of the possible substrings starting from `ith` and `jth` index. 
2. If both the characters of `s` and `t` match, there are two possibilities:
	1. To include `s[i]`, in which case both `i` and `j` will increment.
	2. To exclude `s[i]`, in which case only `i` will increment. 
3. Store the result in `dp[i][j]`.
