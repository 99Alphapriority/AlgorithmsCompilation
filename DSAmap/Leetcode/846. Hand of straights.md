1. If the number of cards cannot be divided into `groupSize`, return false.
```cpp
	if(n % groupSize != 0)
		return false;
```
2. Iterate through the given vector and insert the elements with their occurrences in a hash map.
3. Run a while loop until the hash map is empty.
	1. Run a for loop for `groupSize`
	2. If the value of `mp[curr + i]` is equal to zero, this means that the cards are not consecutive. Return false. 
	3. Decrement the value of `mp[curr+i]`.
	4. Check if the value of `mp[curr+i]` is less than 1, this means that it is already been included in group(s), and should be removed from the hash map.
4. Return false
