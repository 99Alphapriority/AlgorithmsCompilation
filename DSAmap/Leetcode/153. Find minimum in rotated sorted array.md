1. Create a min variable and assume that `nums[mid]` is the smallest element in the array.
2. Check if `nums[0]` is greater than `nums[size - 1]`
	2.1. Check if `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[size - 1]`. 
		2.1.1. This means that the smallest element is present between `nums[mid + 1]` and `nums[size - 1]`. So, update left value to `mid + 1`.
		2.1.2. If FALSE this means that the smallest element is present between `nums[0]` and `nums[mid - 1]`. So, update right value to `mid - 1`.
	2.2. If FALSE this means that `nums[0]` is the smallest element and return the value.
3. Write a WHILE loop to perform binary search on the remaining array to find the minimum value.
4. Return the minimum value.
