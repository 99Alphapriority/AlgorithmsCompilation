1. Use 4 pointers to solve this question.
2. Sort the given `nums` vector.
```cpp
	sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
```
3. 2 pointers are fixed and 2 pointers are incremented and decremented for every iteration of the fixed pointers under some condition.
```cpp
	for(int i = 0; i < size; i++)
	{
		//if same element is encountered skip that index
		if(i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1])
			continue;
		//Run another loop that will iterate from i+1 to size-2
		//size-2 as 2 more pointers will be used.
		for(int j = i +1; j< size-2; j++)
		{
			//if same element is encountered skip that index
			if(j > i+1 && nums[j] == nums[j-1])
				continue;

			//create 2 pointers
			int low = j+1;
			int high = size-1;

			while(low < high)
			{
				/*check if the sum == target
					high--; low++;
				if sum < target
					low++;
				if sum > target
					high--;
			}
		}
	}
```
