1. Create 3 vectors as follows:
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> ans;
vector<int> curr;
vector<bool> visited(nums.size(), false);
```
2. Create a recursive function as follows:
```cpp
	void dfs(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& curr, vector<vector<int>>& ans, vector<bool>& visited);
```
3. Create a base case for the recursive function:
```cpp
if(curr.size() == nums.size())
{
	ans.push_back(curr);
	return;
}
```
4. Run a `for` loop from `i=0` to `i < nums.size()`.
5. Check if the `ith` element has already been visited or not. If not visited then proceed.
6. Mark the `ith` element as visited. This is done because every element in the `ans` should be distinct. 
```cpp
	visited[i] = true;
```
7. Push the `ith` element to the `curr` vector.
8. Make a recursive call to the `dfs()`.
9. Pop the last element from the `curr` vector. 
10. Mark the `ith` element as not visited. This is done for the next iteration of the `for` loop where the this element can be used again. 
11. Return the `ans` vector.
