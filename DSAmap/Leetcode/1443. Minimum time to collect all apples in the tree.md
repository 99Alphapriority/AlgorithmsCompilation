1. Create an adjacency list using the given edges vector.
```cpp
	vector<vector<int>> adj (n);

	for(auto edge: edges)
	{
		adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
		adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
	}
```
2. Create a DFS function that iterates through the adjacency list and checks if the current node has apple or not.
