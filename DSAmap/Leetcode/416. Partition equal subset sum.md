1. Use an unordered set to keep track of all the possible sum for a number at any given index.
2. If the total sum of all the number is odd, then partition equal subset sum cannot be possible. 
3. Iterate through the unordered set and the `nums` vector, if the sum is equal to `target/2`, then return true.
