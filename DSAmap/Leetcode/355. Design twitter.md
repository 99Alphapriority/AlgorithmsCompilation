1. Create a vector of pairs to store the userId and tweetId.
2. Create an unordered map to store the list of followeee's against each User. An unordered set can be used as a list
```cpp
	unordered_map<int/*userId*/, unordered_set<int>/*followers*/> followMap;
```
3. For posting the tweet push the userId and postId to the `posts` vector.
```cpp
	posts.puhs_back({userId, tweetId});
```
4. For follow and unfollow, simple insert or remove the followeeId from the followerMap against the followerId
```cpp
	//for Follow
	followMap[followerId].insert(followeeId);

	//for Unfollow
	followMap[followerId].remove(followeeId);
```
5. For news feed iterate through the posts vector in reverse order, as the latest posts will be stored at the end of the vector. 
6. Check if the userId against every tweet is posted by the user that follows the user denoted by UserId or if the post is posted by the user itself.
