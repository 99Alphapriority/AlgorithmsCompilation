1. Use DFS to solve this question.
2. Iterate through the nodes and calculate the path sum for left and right tree for every node. 
3. If the max path for a subtree is less than 0 then ignore that path. 
4. Check the current path sum of a node by adding the node value to left subtree and right subtree.
5. Check if the current subtree path is greater than the previously calculated sum path
