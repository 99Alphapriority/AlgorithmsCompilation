1. It is guaranteed that the given nodes exist in the BST.
2. Check if the value of the given nodes is less than the value of the current tree node. This means that the given nodes
   exist in the left subtree.
	`if((p->val < root->val) && (q->val < root->val))
	``	return lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
3. Check if the value of the given nodes is greater than the value of the current tree node. This means that the given nodes
   exist in the right subtrree.
	`if((p->val > root->val) && (q->val > root->val))
	``	return lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
4. If the above two conditions are not satisfied this means that either the given nodes exist in separate trees or one of the node is equal to the current root node. Return the root node. 
	`return root;
