1. Create a trie data structure using the given vector of `words`.
2. Iterate through the given board and check if the character `board[i][j]` exists in the trie. If exists then check the character `board[i][j]` is the end of the word. Perform DFS(horizontal and vertical) on the current position of the board.
3. If end of the word then add the current `word` to the `ans` vector.
4. If the character `board[i][j]` does not exist in the trie then return from the search function and check for next character.
