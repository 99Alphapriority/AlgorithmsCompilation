1. Create a `currMax` variable that will keep track of the maximum value so far for the `ith` level.
2. Perform DFS on the tree.
3. Check if the node value is greater than or equal to the `currMax`.
		3.1. If TRUE, increment the global `ans` variable.
4. Recursive call the `dfs()` for the left and right node, while passing the greater value of `currMax` and `root->val`.
		`dfs(root->left, max(currMax, root->val));
		`dfs(root->right, max(currMax, root->val));
5. Return the `ans` variable.
