1. Create a 2D matrix of length `(word1.size() + 1) x (word2.size() + 1)`.
2. Initialize the first row and column. 
3. Iterate through the matrix. Check the strings
4. If `i - 1` and `j - 1` character of the words are same then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
5. Else `dp[i][j]` is the minimum of the insert(`dp[i, j-1]`), delete(`dp[i - 1][j]`) or replace(`dp[i-1][j1-]`), plus 1 for the current operation. 
6. Return `dp[m][n]`.
