1. Iterate through the given vector. 
2. Use a `reachable` variable to keep track of the maximum index that can be reached.
```cpp
	reachable = max(reachable, i + nums[i]);
```
3. If `i` is greater than `reachable` this means that the last index cannot be reached from the starting index, hence, return false.
4. If `reachable` is equal to the last index, break the for loop and return true.
