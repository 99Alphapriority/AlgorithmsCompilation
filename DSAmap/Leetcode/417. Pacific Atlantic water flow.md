1. Create 2 vectors `pacific` and `atlantic`. 
```c
	vector<vector<bool>> pacific(m, vector<bool>(n));
	vector<vector<bool>> atlantic(m, vector<bool>(n));
	
```
2. Traverse through the given matrix and check if each element can reach the pacific or not.
	1. Mark that element as `true` if it is able to reach the pacific ocean.
3. Repeat step 2 for `atlantic`.
4. Traverse through both the `pacific` and `atlantic` vector and push the indices in the `ans`.
```c
	if(pacific[i][j] && atlantic[i][j])
		ans.push_back({i,j});
```
5. Return `ans`.
