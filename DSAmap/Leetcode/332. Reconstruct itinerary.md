1. Create a map using a string as the key and a multi set of strings as values.
```cpp
	unordered_map<string, multiset<string>> mp;
	//key-> source, value->destination.
	//multiset stores elements in ascending ordered form
```
2. Create a DFS function. 
3. Run a while loop until multi set of a specific source is not empty. 
4. Store the first string of the multi set in a string variable and erase it from the multi set. 
5. Invoke the DFS function for this string. 
6. When the multi set is empty, insert the source string in the `ans` vector.
