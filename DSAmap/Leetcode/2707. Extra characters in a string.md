1. Create a Trie using the words in the `dictionary`.
2. Create a DFS function that will iterate through the given string `s`.
3. For every character in `s`, there will be two options: either to take that character or skip that character. 
4. If taking the character iterate through the string and the trie, to check if the consecutive characters are part of a word or not. 
5. If the current character in trie is end if the word then take the min of previously calculated result and perform DFS from the next character in the string. 
6. Use a `dp` array to memoize the result.
