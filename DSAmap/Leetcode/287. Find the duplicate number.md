1. Create a slow and fast pointer. Both these pointers start at `nums[0]`.
2. Since the values of the given vector is in between 1 and n, the values can be used as index as the vector is of size n+1.
3. Run a WHILE loop until `slow != fast`, as it is guaranteed that there is a duplicate number.
	3.1. Update the slow and fast pointer in the following manner:
		`slow = nums[slow];
		`fast = nums[nums[fast]];
	3.2. There will be an instance where slow == fast, exit the loop here.
4. Reset the slow pointer to 0.
5. Again run a WHILE loop until slow != fast.
	5.1. Update the slow and fast pointer in the following manner"
		`slow = nums[slow];
		`fast = nums[fast];
	5.2. There will be an instance where slow == fast, exit the loop here.
6. Return the slow value.
