1. Create a structure that contains an array of pointers for each letter of the alphabet and a boolean variable that informs whether the current node in the trie is the end of the word. 
```cpp
	struct trie
	{
		bool isEndOfWord;
		struct trie* children[26];
	};
```
2. Iterate through the given word. Check if the `ith` character of word exists. If not then create a node for that character.
3. After inserting the characters in the trie, set the `isEndofWorld` variable to true for the last character. 
4. For search iterate through the trie and check if the nodes corresponding to the character exist. If the exist then check the value of `isEndOfWord` is true meaning the given word exists in trie.
