1. Create variables to create track of the number of jumps, current index, and the last index that can be reached for the current index.
2. Iterate through the vector until `n-1`.
3. Calculate `jump` such as we can cover the maximum distance. 
4. If the `i` is equal to the `last`, update the `last` variable to `jump` and increment `count`.
5. Return `count`.
