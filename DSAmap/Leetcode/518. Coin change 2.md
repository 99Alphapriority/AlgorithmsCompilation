1. Create a 2D vector to store the number of combinations the can be made with the `ith` coin and `sum`.
2. Create a DFS function to compute the combinations. 
3. If `sum` is equal to the given target, return 1. 
4. If `sum` is greater than the target then return 0. 
5. If the combination has already been computed, return `dp[i][sum]`.
6. For every coin, there are 2 options. Either add the `ith` coin to the sum or move to the next coin. 
```cpp
	dp[i][sum] = dfs(amount, coins, i, sum + coins[i]) + dfs(amount, coins, i + 1, sum);
```
