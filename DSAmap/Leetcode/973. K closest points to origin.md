1. Create a vector to store the distance of the coordinates from the origin and the coordinates itself.
2. Use the above created vector to create a priority queue(min heap).
```cpp
	priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, greater<vector<int>>> pq(data.begin(), data.end());
```
3. Pop `K` elements from the queue and push then to `ans` vector.
