1. Create two variables to keep track of the `newInterval`.
```cpp
	int newStart = newInterval[0];
	int newEnd = newInterval[1];
```
2. Iterate through the `intervals` vector. 
3. Check if the start of the current interval is greater than the end of the `newInterval`, this means than the `newInterval` should be added to the `ans` vector and the remaining `intervals` should be appended to `ans` vector. Return `ans`
```cpp
	if(intervals[i][0] > newEnd)
	{
		ans.push_back(newInterval);
		copy(intervals.begin() + i, intervals.end(), back_insert(ans));
		return ans;
	}
```
4. Check if the end of the current interval is less than `newStart`. Push current interval to the `ans` vector.
```cpp
	if(intervals[i][1] < newStart)
		asn.push_back(intervals[i]);
```
5. If above two conditions are not met, this means that there is some overlap. Calculate the resulting interval and update the value of the `newInterval`
```cpp
	newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]);
	newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1]);
```
6. If the for loop exits this means that the new interval is to be added at the end of intervals
