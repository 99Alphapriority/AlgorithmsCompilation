1. Iterate through the given board until,
	```cpp
	board[i][j] == word[0];
```
2. Call the recursive function `dfs()` with the following parameters:
```cpp
	dfs(vector<vector<cahr>>& board, string word, int i , int j, int idx);
```
3. Check if `i` and `j` are out of bounds or if `board[i][j] != word[idx]`. Return `false` if any of these conditions are true.
4. Check if `idx == word.size() - 1`. This means that all the characters of the word have been searched and found. Return `true`.
5. Change the current character on the board to a sentinel character.
```cpp
	board[i][j] = '#';
```
6. Repeat the search horizontally and vertically by incrementing `idx`.
```cpp
	if(dfs(board, word, i - 1, j, idx + 1)
		|| dfs(board, word, i + 1, j, idx + 1)
		|| dfs(board, word, i, j - 1, idx + 1)
		|| dfs(board, word, i, j+ 1, idx + 1))
	{
		return true;
	}
```
7. Revert the current character on the board back to its original value.
```cpp
	board[i][j] = word[idx];
```
