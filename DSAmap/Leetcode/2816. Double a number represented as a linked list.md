1. Reverse the given linked list. 
2. Iterate through the reversed list and multiply the node value by 2. 
3. Check if the node value is greater than or equal to 10. 
4. If greater than or equal to 10, then calculate the carry value and add it to the product in the next node. Update the value of the current node to make it a single digit. 
5. If the reversed list is finished and there is still some carry value left, then create a new node and assign the carry value to that node. 
6. Reverse the list again.
7. Return the reversed list.
