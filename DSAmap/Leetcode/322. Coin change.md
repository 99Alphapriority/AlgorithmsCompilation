1. Create a `dp` vector of size `amount + 1` and initialize it with `amount + 1`.
2. We know that for amount = 0, we need 0 coins. So, `dp[0] = 0`.
3. Run a for loop to calculate the minimum number of coins required from amount = 1 to amount = `amount`
```cpp
	for(int i = 1; i < amount + 1; i++)
```
4. Create another for loop to traverse the `coins` vector and check if amount `i`  is possible using using the coins in `coins`, i.e. the difference between `i` and `coins[j]` should be greater than equal to 0.
```cpp
	for(int j = 0; j < coins.szie(); j++)
	{
		if(i - coins[j] >= 0)
			dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - coins[j]]);
	}
```
5. Check if `dp[amount] == amount + 1`, meaning it is not possible to use any combination of coins to sum up to amount, return -1.
6. Return `dp[amount]`.
