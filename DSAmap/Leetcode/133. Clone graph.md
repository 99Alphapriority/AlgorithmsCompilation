1. Create an unordered map to store the address of the new graph nodes. The given graph will be used as `key` and the new graph nodes will be used as `value`.
```cpp
	unordered_map<Node*, Node*> mp;
```
2. Create a new node and add it to `mp`.
```cpp
	Node *copy = new Node(node->val);
	mp[node] = copy;
```
3. Create a queue to keep track of the nodes in the given graph. Push the first node into the queue.
```cpp
	queue<Node *> q;
	q.push(node);
```
4. Run a `while` loop until the queue is empty
5. Create a new temp node to point to the first node in the queue.
```cpp
	Node *curr = q.front();
```
6. Pop the node from the queue.
7. Run a `for` loop for all the `neighbors` of the `curr` node.
```cpp
	for(int i = 0; i < curr->neighbors.size(); i++)
```
8. Create a new `neighbor` node that points to the nodes in the `neighbors` vector.
```cpp
	Node *neighbor = curr->neighbors[i];
```
9. Check if this node exists in the map
	1. If it doesn't exist, then create a `(key, value)` pair in the map and push the node into the queue.
```cpp
		if(mp.find(neighbor) == mp.end())
		{
			mp[neighbor] = new Node(neighbor->val);
			q.push(niehgbor);
		}
```
10. Push the `neighbor` into the `neighbors` vector of the new graph node
```cpp
	mp[curr]->neighbors.push_back(neighbor);
```
11. Return the `copy` node.
