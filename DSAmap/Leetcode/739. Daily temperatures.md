1. Create a vector of the same size as the given vector and a stack to store the indices of the vector. 
2. Push the 0th index in the stack.
3. Traverse through the given vector using a FOR loop starting from 1st index
	3.1. Check if the stack is not empty AND if the current value of the vector is greater than the value stored at the index stored at the top most element of the stack.
		3.1.1. If TRUE, store the difference between i and the `st.top()` in the ans vector at position `ans[st.top()]`
		3.1.2. Pop the stack. 
		3.1.3. Repeat this procedure until the stack is not empty and the vector element is greater than `st.top()` using a WHILE loop.
	3.2. Push the current index in the vector.
4. After FOR loop there might be some values in the stack, which implies that there is no warmer temperatures for those days. A value 0 is assigned to them by default while initializing the vector.
5. Return ans vector.
