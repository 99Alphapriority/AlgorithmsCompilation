1. Iterate through the linked list until a node with child is encountered. 
2. After a child is encountered make a recursive call to the `flatten()` function with the head of the child list as a parameter. Store the returned node in a `temp` node.
3. Create a `next` node that points to the next node of the current node.
4. Perform a join function on the current `node` and `temp` node.
5. Iterate through the `temp` node to reach the last node of the list. Join the `temp` node to the `next` node.
6. Set `node->child` as NULL.
7. and update `node` to `next`.
8. If no child node is encountered then return the head of the list.
