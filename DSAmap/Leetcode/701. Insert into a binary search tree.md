1. Check if the current node value is greater than the `val`, this means that the new node will be inserted in the left subtree. 
2. Similarly check if the current node value is smaller than the `val`, this means that the new node will be inserted in the right subtree. 
3. When the current node is NULL, then create a new node and return its address.
