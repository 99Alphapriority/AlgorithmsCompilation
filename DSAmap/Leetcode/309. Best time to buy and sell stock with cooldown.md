1. Create a DFS function as there are 3 choices for every index. 
2. Create a 2D array to keep track of the profit for buy or sell state for every stock. 
```cpp
	vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(2, -1));
```
3. First choice: Cooldown
	1. Invoke the DFS function for `i+1` without changing the state.
```cpp
		cooldown = dfs(price, i+1, state, dp);
```
4. Second choice: Buy
	1. Calculate the profit if we buy the `ith` stock. And cache the maximum of cooldown and buy.
```cpp
		buy = dfs(prices, i + 1, !state, dp) - prices[i];
		dp[i][state] = max(buy, cooldown);
``` 
5. Third choice: Sell
	1. Calculate the profit if we sell the `ith` stock. Cache the the maximum of cooldown and sell. 
```cpp
		sell = dfs(prices, i + 2, !state, dp) + prices[i];
		dp[i][state] = max(sell, cooldown);
```
6. Return `dp[i][state]`.
