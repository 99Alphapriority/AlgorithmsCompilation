1. Create a Map. Go through the given array and populate the map using `nums[i]` as the key and incrementing the value every time that key is encountered.
2. Iterate through the map. Check if the key of the next item in the map is current key + 1 and the value is greater than or equal to 1.
	2.1.	If true increment the count variable and check if it is the largest consecutive sequence.
	2.2.	If false, reset the count variable to 0.
