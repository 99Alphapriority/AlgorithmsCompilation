1. Iterate through the linked list and check the length of the list and assign a pointer to the tail of the linked list. 
2. Calculate the node that will be the new head using the formula `k = k % length`.
3. Use a for loop to traverse to the `(count - k) th` node.
4. Assign the head of the list to `tail->next`.
5. The new head will be `temp->next`.
6. Change `temp->next` to NULL.
