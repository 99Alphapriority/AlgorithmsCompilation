1. For every element in the given `nums` vector there are 2 options: either to include that element or to not include that element.
2. Create a `dfs()` that will be invoked recursively. Pass address of the given `nums` , `curr` and `ans` vector as parameters to the function. Also pass a `start` variable that will keep track of the `nums` vector index.
	2.1. Push the `curr` vector into the `ans` vector.
	2.2. Run a FOR loop from `i = start` to `i < nums.size()`.
		2.2.1. Push `nums[i]` into the `curr` vector. 
		2.2.2. Recursive call the `dfs()`.
		2.2.3. Pop the last element in the `curr` vector.
3. Return the `ans` vector.
