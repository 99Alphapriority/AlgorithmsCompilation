1. Create a new node `head`.
2. Create a node pointer `temp` that points to `head` at the beginning.
3. Iterate through the lists until one of the list is not completed.
```cpp
	while(list1 && list2)
	{}
```
4. Check which node has the smaller value. Make that node as the next node to the `temp` pointer, and move that pointer to the next node.
```cpp
	if(list1->val < list2->val)
	{
		temp->next = list1;
		list1 = list1->next;
	}
	else
	{
		temp->next = list2;
		list2 = list2->next;
	}
```
5. Move the `temp` pointer to the next node.
6. Check if any of the list is not empty. Make the current node of the list and the next node to the `temp` pointer.
```cpp
	if(list1)
		temp->next = list1;
	if(list2)
		temp->next = list;
```
7. Return `head->next`.
