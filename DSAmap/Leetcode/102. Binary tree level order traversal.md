1. Use Breadth First Search to solve this question.
2. Create a queue to store the address of a node.
	```cpp
	queue<TreeNode*> q;
```
3. Push the address of root node to the queue.
4. Run a WHILE loop until the loop is empty.
	1. Create a count integer to store the size of the queue. This will help us determine the number of elements at any
	     given level of the tree.
		```cpp
		int count = q.size();
```
	2. Create a vector to store the elements at any given level of the tree.
		```cpp
	vector<int> res;
```
	3. Run a FOR loop from `i = 0` to `i < count`. This loop will be used to pop the elements from the queue corresponding to 
	     current tree level. And push the children of the popped node.
		1. Create a node pointer such that:
			```cpp
			TreeNode* node = q.front();	
```
		2. Push the value of this node into the res vector.
			```cpp
			res.push_back(node->val);
			```
		1. Pop this node from the queue.
			```cpp
			q.pop();
			```
		1. Check if the left child of this node exists.
			1. If TRUE, push that node to the queue.
				```cpp
			q.push(node->left);
```

		5. Check if the right child of this node exists.
			1. If TRUE, push that node to the queue.
				```cpp
				q.push(node->right);
```
	4. Push the `res` vector to the `ans` vector.
5. Return the `ans` vector.
