1. Create a hash map to store the occurrences of each character in the string. 
2. Run a while loop until the end of the string. 
3. Insert each character encountered in a set. 
4. Decrement the value of the character in the hash map.
5. If the value of a character is less than 1, then remove that character from the set. 
6. Check if the set is empty then push the length of the current string, and update the value of `i`.
```cpp
	if(st.empty())
	{
		ans.push_back(j - i + 1);
		i = j + 1;
	}
```
7. Increment the `j` pointer.
8. Return `ans`.
