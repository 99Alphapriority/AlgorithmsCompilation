1. Sort the given `intervals` vector.
2. Iterate through the vector until `n - 1`.
3. Check if the end of the current interval is greater than the start of the next interval, this means that there is overlapping. 
	1. Check if the end of the current interval is less than the end of the next interval, this means that the interval with the greater end needs to be replaced with the current interval.
	2. Increment `result`, as overlap found.
```cpp
	if(intervals[i][1] > intervals[i+1][0])
	{
		if(intervals[i][1] < intervals[i+1][1])
			intervals[i+1] = intervals[i];

		result++;
	}
```
4. Return `result`.
