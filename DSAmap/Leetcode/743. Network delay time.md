1. Create a hash map to store the destination and time value pair for each source node.
```cpp
	unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> mp;
	for(auto &vec: times)
	{
		int u = vec[0];
		int v = vec[1];
		int w = vec[2];
		
		mp[u].push_back({v,w});
	}
```
2. Create `nodes` vector that store the time taken to reach the `ith` node from the node `k`.
```cpp
	vector<int> nodes(n + 1, INT_MAX);
	nodes[k] = 0;
```
3. Create a min heap to keep track of all the nodes reachable from the source node.
```cpp
	priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int,int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
	pq.push({nodes[k], k});
```
4. Run a while loop until the queue is empty.
5. Pop the top node from the queue and calculate the time taken to reach all the nodes possible from that node. 
6. If the nodes reachable are lower than the time stored in `nodes` vector, then update the `nodes` vector and push this node into the queue.
