1. Create a vector to keep track if the node has been visited.
```cpp
	vector<vector<bool>> visited(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
```
2. Create a priority queue to keep track of the nodes connected to the current node.
3. Run a while loop until the queue is empty. 
4. Update the `ans` variable if the current node value is greater than the previous node value stored in`ans`.
5. Push all the connected nodes to the queue. 
6. If the current node is the last cell of the grid, return `ans`.
