1.  Iterate through the given vector of `words` and insert each word into an unordered map.
2. Iterate through the given string such that:
```cpp
	wordsWindow = words[0].size() * words.size();
	
	while(i + wordsWindow <= s.size())
```
This is because all the strings or `words` should be present in the string `s` to be considered as substring of `words`.
3. Check `s.substr(i, wordsWindow)` if all the `words` are present consecutively.
4. Iterate through the substring with a window size of `words[0].size()`.
5. If the word is already encountered in the string then return `false` and increment `i`.
6. If all the words are present in the string then push `i` into `ans`.
