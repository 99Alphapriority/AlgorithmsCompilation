1. Iterate through `t` and create a hash map containing all the characters of `t`
2. Iterate through the given string `s`. 
3. Check if the current character exists in the map. If true then decrement the counter value.
```cpp
	if(m[s[j]] > 0)
		counter--;
```
4. Decrement the count of current character in the map. 
```cpp
	m[s[j]]--;
```
5. Move the end pointer.
6. Check if the counter is 0, this means that the current window has all the character of the string `t`. Run a while loop to calculate the window length and move the start pointer.
7. Check if the current window is shorter than the previous window length. If true then update the `minStart` index and the `minLength` value.
```cpp
		if(j - i < minLenght)
		{
			minStart = i;
			minLength = j - 1;
		}
```
8. Increment the count of the character pointed by the start index of the window. Check if its count is greater than 0, this means that this character is present in `t`. Increment the `counter` and the start pointer. This will break the while loop.
9. Return the substring of length `minLenght` starting from index `minStart`.
```cpp
	return s.substr(minStart, minLength);
```
