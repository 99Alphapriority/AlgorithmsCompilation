1. Create a vector to store the frequency of each task.
2. Iterate through the previously created vector and insert all the non-zero values into a priority queue.
3. Run a while loop until the queue is not empty.
4. For every iteration there can be maximum `n+1` tasks before the same task can be run again. 
5. Run a for loop from `i = 0` to `i <= n+1`.
6. Retrieve the top most element from the queue. Decrement this frequency and insert it into a temporary array. 
7. Run another for loop that transfers the frequency from `temp` array back to the queue if the frequency is greater than 0.
8. Check if the queue is empty then `time += temp.size()` else `time += n + 1`.
9. Return `time`.
