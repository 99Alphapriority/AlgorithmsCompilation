1. Create a stack of integers to keep track of the indices of `(` encountered in the given string.
2. Push -1 into the stack.
3. Iterate through the given string.
4. If `(` encountered, push into the stack.
5. If  `)` encountered check if the top of stack is not -1, this means `)` is valid. Pop from the stack.
6. Calculate the length of the valid string as follows:
```cpp
	ans = max(ans, i - st.top());
```
7. Return `ans`.
