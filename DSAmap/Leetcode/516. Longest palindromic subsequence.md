1. Create a 2D array for memoization. 
2. Create a DFS function. 
3. If `i` is greater than `j`, return 0.
4. If `i` is equal to `j`, return 1.
5. Check if the `ith` and the `jth` character of the string `s` are same then store 2 + recursively call the DFS function with `i+1` and `j-1`.
6. Else take the max of the DFS function, by either incrementing `i` or decrementing `j`.
