1. Use sliding window to solve this question.
2. Iterate through the string and increment the count of the current character. 
3. Create a `maxCount` variable that stores the count of maximum character in the window
```cpp
	maxCount = max(maxCount, count[s[end] - 'A']);
```
4. Check if the count of different characters in the sliding window is greater than the given `k`. This means the number of characters we have to change to make the window valid is greater than `k`, thus not possible. If `true` then decrement the count of the character pointed by `start` variable and move the `start` counter. 
```cpp
	if(end - start + 1 - maxCount > k)
	{
		count[s[start]]--;
		start++;
	}
```
5. Check and store the current size of the window
```cpp
	ans = max(ans, end - start + 1);
```
6. Increment the `end` counter.
