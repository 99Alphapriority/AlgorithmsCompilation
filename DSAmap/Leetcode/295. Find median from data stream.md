1. Create a max-heap priority queue to store lower values of the stream.
2. Create a min-heap priority queue to store higher values of the stream.
3. Insert the first data from the stream in `left`.
4. For every new data check the size of the queues, they should not differ by more than 1 element.
5. Check if `left` is greater than `right`. 
	1. If the `num` is greater than `left.top()`, insert `num` to the `right` queue.
	2. Else, move the top most element of the `left` queue to the `right` queue and then add the `num` to the left queue.
6. If `right` is greater than `left`.
	1. If the `num` is smaller than `right.top()`, insert `num` to the `left` queue.
	2. Else, move the top most element of the `right` queue to the `left` queue and then add the `num` to the `right` queue.
7. If both the queues are equal in size then calculate the median as follow:
```cpp
	double res = (left.top() + right.top()) / 2.0;
```
8. Else return the top most element of the bigger queue.
