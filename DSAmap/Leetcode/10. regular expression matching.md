1. Create a DFS function to iterate through the strings. 
2. Create a 2D array to keep track whether the strings from `i` and `j` match or not. 
3. If `j` is equal to the length of string `p`, check if `i` is also equal to the length of `s`.
4. If both the current characters of string `s` and `p` match or , current character of `p` is `.`, then set the `match` variable to true. 
5. Check if `j+1 th` character of `p` is `*`. 
6. There are two possibilities at this point, either to take `*` or to not take `*`.
7. If not taking `*`, then the DFS function will be as follows:
```cpp
	bool not_take = dfs(s, p, i, j+2);
```
8. If taking `*`, then the DFS function will be as follows:
```cpp
	bool take = match + dfs(s, p, i+1, j);
```
9. Return true if either of step 7 or 8 is true.
10. Else increment both `i` and `j` and invoke the DFS function.
