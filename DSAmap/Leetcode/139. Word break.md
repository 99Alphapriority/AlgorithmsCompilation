1. Create an unordered set to store all the strings in `wordDict` for a O(1) lookup time.
2. Start checking if a substring of `s` is present in the unordered set. If it is present make a recursive call the `solve()` function for the remaining string. 
3. For base case check if the provided `idx` is greater than or equal to the size of the string `s`.
4. Perform memoization by storing the return values in a `dp` array.
