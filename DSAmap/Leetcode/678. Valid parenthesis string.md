1. Check if the string is balanced or not. 
2. Iterate through the string from start to end. 
3. If `s[i]` is `(` or `*`, increment `balanced` variable. Else decrement the `balanced` variable.
4. If `balanced` variable is negative this means that there is some invalid bracket, return false.
5. After the for loop, if `balanced` is equal to 0, return true.
6. Reset the `balanced` variable to 0.
7. Now iterate through the string in reverse order. Increment the `balanced` variable if `s[i]` is `)` or `*`. Else decrement the `balanced` variable. 
8.  If `balanced` variable is negative this means that there is some invalid bracket, return false.
9. After the for loop, return true.
