1. Using DFS compute the height of the left and right subtree.
	1.1. If the absolute difference between the left and right subtree is greater than 1, return -1.
	1.2. In every recursive call of DFS check if the value of left or right tree is -1. If TRUE return -1.
	1.3. Return the height of the tree. 
		`return 1 + max(left, right);
	1.4. Use the base case to exit the function.
		`if(NULL == root)
			`return 0;
2. Check the value of the height variable returned. 
	2.1. `If (height == -1)`, this means that the absolute difference between the left and right subtree is greater than 1.	
		`return false;
	2.2. Else return true.
