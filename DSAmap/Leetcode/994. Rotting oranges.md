1. Use BFS to solve this question.
2. Create a queue that stores the coordinates of the rotten oranges. 
3. Iterate through the given `grid`. Increment the number of fresh oranges encountered and push the coordinates of the rotten oranges in the queue. 
4. Check if queue is empty a and no fresh orange was present, `return 0`.
5. Run a `while` loop till the the queue is empty.
	1. Run a `for` loop from `i=0` to `i < size`.
	2. Pop the coordinates from the queue.
	3. Check all the directions of the coordinates in the queue for fresh oranges. 
	4. Push the new rotten orange coordinates to the queue.
	5. Decrement the number of fresh oranges.
	6. After the `for` loop increment the `ans` variable which keeps track of minutes elapsed.
6. Check if the number of fresh oranges is 0
	1. Return `ans`
7. If the queue is empty and the number of fresh oranges is not 0, this means there are fresh oranges in the grid that are not adjacent to any rotten orange, `retur -1`.
