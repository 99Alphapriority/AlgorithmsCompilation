1. Iterate through the `triplets` vector. 
2. If any of the indices if `triplets[i]` is greater than the members of `target`, continue with the iteration.
3. Else check if any of the values in `triplets[i]` is equal to the any of the values in `target`. Insert the index into a set. 
4. After iterating through the vector, check if the size of the set is equal to 3. This means that there are `triplets` that can be merged to make the `target`.
