1. Create an unordered_map.
	unordered_map<Node*, Node*> mp;
2. Iterate through the given list and create a new list, while storing the address of the new list node in a map
   Using the address of the given node as key.
	mp[head] = new Node(head->val);
3. Reset the temp pointer to head.
4. Iterate through the given node using the WHILE loop. Update the next and random pointers as follows:
	Node *p = mp[temp];
	p->next = mp[temp->next];
	p->random = mp[temp->random];
5. return the head of the new list.
	return mp[head];
