1. Break the list into 2 halves. Use hare and tortoise method to divide the list. 
	1.1. Create a slow pointer that points to the head of the list. 
	1.2. Create a fast pointer that points to head->next.
	1.3. Run a WHILE loop until fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL;
		1.3.1. Update the slow pointer as follows:
			slow = slow->next;
		1.3.2. Update the fast pointer as follows:
			fast = fast->next->next;
	1.4. When the loop exits, the slow pointer will point to the middle node.
	     Update the pointers as follows:
		fast = slow->next;	This will act as a head to the second list.
		slow->next = NULL;	This ensures that the first list is half the length of the original list.
2. Reverse the second list. 
3. Merge both the list in alternate fashion.
