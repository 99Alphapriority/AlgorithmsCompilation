1. Check the number of occurances of each given number row wise.
	1.1. Create a map. Use the number encountered in the given grid as key. Increment the value at every key occurance.
	1.2. Check if the value corresponding to the key is greater than 1. If true return 1.
2. Check the number of occurances of each given number row wise.
	2.1. Create a map. Use the number encountered in the given grid as key, Increment the value at every key occurance.
	2.2. Check if the value corresponding to the key is greater than 1. If true return 1.
3. Check the number of occurances of each given number in a single 3x3 grid.
	3.1. Create a nested map. Use the matrix number(0-8) as the key for the parent map and the number countered as the key for the nested map.
		map<int, map<int,int>> mp;

		mp[//matrix number(0-8)][//number encountered(1-9)] ---> value(number of occurances)
	3.2. Create a variable k that will keep track of the matrix number.
		3.2.1. k will be initialised to 0.
		3.2.2. Value of k will change as follows:
			k = 0 for i < 3
			k = 3 for i < 6
			k = 6 for i >= 6
			
			k = 0 for j < 3
			k++ for j == 3
			k++ for j == 6
	3.3. check if the number of occurance for a number in a 3x3 grid is more than 1. If true then return 1.
