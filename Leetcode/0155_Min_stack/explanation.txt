1. Create a structure having an integer value and a pointer to next node in the list.
2. 2 stacks will be created. One for user opertaions and other one for keeping track of the minimum element in the stack.
3. push()
	3.1. Create 2 temp nodes and malloc memory.
	3.2. Assign the given value to the node. 
		3.2.1. If HEAD node is empty, assign NULL to the next pointer of the node.
		3.2.2. Else assign the HEAD to the next pointer of the node.		
	3.3. Update the value of head to point to the new tmp node.
	3.4. Assign value to the Min stack node.
		3.4.1. If HEAD node is empty. assign the given value to the node, and store this value in a global minVal variable.
		       Assign NULL to the next pointer of the node.
		3.4.2. Else, compare the given value and the minVal variable, store the smaller value in the node.
		       Assign the min stack HEAD to the next pointer of the node.
	3.5. Update the value of the min stack HEAD to point to the new temp node.
4. pop()
	4.1. Remove the head node from both the stacks.
5. top()
	5.1. Return the value stored in the HEAD node of the stack.
6. getMin()
	6.1. Return the value stored in the HEAD node of the min stack.
