1. Use DFS to solve this question.
2. Create a Base case where if root nodes of both the tree as NULL, return true. This means that both trees have the same number of nodes.
	if(p == NULL && q == NULL)
		return true;
3. If either of the trees has more nodes than the other, returhn false.
	if((p == NULL) || (q == NULL))
		return false;
4. Check if the value in the current node of the tree is same or not.
	4.1. If same recursively call the isSameTree function for both the left child and right child.
		if(isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right))
			return true;
		else
			return false;
	4.2. If the values are different, return false.
