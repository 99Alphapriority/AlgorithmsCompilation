1. Create a new node for the result list.
2. Create a temp_p pointer variable to keep track of the head of the result list.
3. Add the value in the first node of the given lists and store this value in the head of the new list.
4. Calculate the carryOn value by dividing the result of step 3 by 10.
5. Update the value stored in the new list by (val)%10. This is done to ensure that every node has a single digit only.
6. Move the pointer to next node if exist.
7. Add the value in the current nodes and add the carryOn values calculated earlier.
8. Compute the carryOn value by dividing the result of step 7 by 10.
9. Update the result node value by (val)%10 to ensure only single digit is left in the node.
10. Move the pointer to the necxt node if exist.
11. Repeat step 7-10 till the end of the given lists.
12. If the carryOn value is greater than 0 by the end of the lists, create a new node and assign the carryOn value to it.
